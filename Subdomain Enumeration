Subdomain Enumeration — Task-Wise Answers

Task 1 — Brief

What is a subdomain enumeration method beginning with B? → Brute Force

What is a subdomain enumeration method beginning with O? → OSINT

What is a subdomain enumeration method beginning with V? → Virtual Host

Task 2 — OSINT — SSL/TLS Certificates
• What domain was logged on crt.sh at 2020-12-26? → store.tryhackme.com

Task 3 — OSINT — Search Engines
• What is the TryHackMe subdomain beginning with B discovered using the above Google search? → blog.tryhackme.com

Task 4 — DNS Bruteforce
• What is the first subdomain found with DNS bruteforce? → web55.acmeitsupport.thm
(Some walkthroughs list api.acmeitsupport.thm here, depending on which enumeration tool is simulated; but Rahul’s lists web55.acmeitsupport.thm as the result after running Sublist3r – so we include his ordering.)

Task 5 — OSINT with Sublist3r
• What is the subdomain discovered with Sublist3r? → web55.acmeitsupport.thm

Task 6 — Virtual Hosts
• First subdomain discovered using virtual host enumeration (ffuf/wordlist): → delta
• Second subdomain discovered using virtual host enumeration: → yellow
