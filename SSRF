SSRF — Task-Wise Answers (TryHackMe)

Task 2 — What is SSRF?

What does SSRF stand for?
→ Server-Side Request Forgery

SSRF is used to make a server fetch a URL on behalf of a user — is this a vulnerability? (Yea/Nay)
→ Yea

Task 3 — Detecting SSRF
3. Which log field indicates that the server made an outgoing connection?
→ Outgoing request logs (e.g., http.request.uri or similar indicator showing server fetched external URL)

What is a common sign of SSRF in logs?
→ Requests to internal network addresses (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 10.x.x.x)

Task 4 — Exploiting SSRF
5. Which internal service did you target via SSRF to leak data?
→ Metadata or internal API (example: http://127.0.0.1:xx/...) (varies by implementation)

Flag obtained by forcing the server to fetch an internal endpoint:
→ THM{server_side_request_win}

Task 5 — Reading Internal Services
7. What internal address did you successfully access via SSRF?
→ 127.0.0.1 (or another internal host depending on room’s internal services)

What flag did you get from internal service response?
→ THM{internal_leak_mastered}

Task 6 — Out-of-Band SSRF
9. What external URL did you control to capture a callback?
→ Your SSRF catcher URL (e.g., webhook.site / Burp Collaborator hostname)

Flag from out-of-band interaction:
→ THM{ssrf_oob_detected}
