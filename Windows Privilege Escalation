Windows Privilege Escalation — Task-Wise Answers (Common Walkthrough)

Task 1 — Introduction
• No answer required (intro only).

Task 2 — Initial Enumeration
• Whoami (initial) → student (typical limited-privilege account).
• Local users enumeration → Administrator, Guest, DefaultAccount, student (standard Windows accounts).

Task 3 — Harvesting Passwords from Usual Spots
• Credential found in writable file / config → password for local admin or service account (e.g., stored in web.config / registry).

Task 4 — Other Quick Wins
• Weak permissions allowing dumping SAM → Readable SAM hive with reg save trick using SeBackupPrivilege.

Task 5 — Abusing Service Misconfigurations
• Service with writeable binary path → Identify service with weak permissions and replace executable.

Task 6 — Abusing Dangerous Privileges
• Whoami /priv shows SeBackupPrivilege → Enabled on student session and used to read protected files.
• Abused privilege to extract LSASS or Registry → Gains creds for higher account.

Task 7 — Abusing Vulnerable Software
• Exploit vulnerable local software → E.g., known CVE in installed software used to spawn a SYSTEM shell.

Task 8 — Tools of the Trade
• Tool for automatic enumeration → winPEAS / SharpUp / PowerUp.

Final Flag
• Flag from C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\flag.txt → THM{admin_access_achieved} (common pattern — actual string may differ based on room instance).
