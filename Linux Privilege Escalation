Task 1 — Initial Enumeration

Which user are you initially logged in as?
→ student

Which command did you use to find SUID-root files?
→ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null

Task 2 — LinPEAS Enumeration

Which automated tool did you run to assist enumeration?
→ linpeas.sh

Which service binary has suspicious SUID bits set?
→ backup_manager

Which file contains credentials found during enumeration?
→ /home/student/.backup_pass

Task 3 — Credentials & SSH

What password was discovered in the discovered credentials file?
→ Th3B@ckupP@ss

Which user’s shell did you access next with these credentials?
→ backup_user

Task 4 — Path-Based Enumeration

After switching to backup_user, which directory contained a backup script?
→ /opt/backup_scripts

Which script was vulnerable to privilege escalation?
→ full_backup.sh

Task 5 — Exploiting Script

What was the misconfigured command in the script allowing escalation?
→ tar xf /tmp/backup.tar -C /important/data (example misuse of tar executable)

Which exploitable binary did the script call without full path?
→ tar

Task 6 — Gaining Root

What binary did you replace with a malicious script to escalate?
→ tar (via PATH manipulation)

What was the result after executing the manipulated script?
→ Root shell

Final flag found in root’s home directory:
→ THM{LINUX_ROOT_3SC4L4T3D}

Task 7 — Clean-Up / Detection

Which audit log could reveal misuse of the tar command?
→ /var/log/auth.log

What mitigation could have prevented this escalation?
→ Use full paths and least-privilege in scripts
