Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — Task-Wise Answers

Task 1 — Basics

What does XSS stand for? → Cross-Site Scripting

Which property could contain the user’s session token? → document.cookie

Which JavaScript method is often used as a proof-of-concept? → alert()

Task 2 — Types of XSS
4. Where in a URL is it logical to test for reflected XSS? → Parameters
5. How are XSS payloads usually stored on a site? → in a database (for stored XSS)
6. What does DOM stand for? → Document Object Model
7. Which unsafe JavaScript function is good to look for in DOM-based XSS? → eval()

Task 3 — Stored / Blind XSS
8. Which tool can be used to test blind XSS? → XSS Hunter Express
9. Which type of XSS is very similar to blind XSS? → Stored XSS

Task 4 — Practical Lab Payloads (Level Exfil & Execution)
10. Example payload that shows an alert with THM:

<script>alert('THM');</script>


(This is used in multiple levels to confirm execution.)

Level where you need to escape a <textarea> to execute JS:
Payload:

</textarea><script>alert('THM');</script>


(This executes when the handler doesn’t properly sanitize.)

Payload to bypass a value attribute in an <input> field:

"><script>alert('THM');</script>


(Used on an input field where the default <script> alone doesn’t run.)

Escaped payload for textarea bypass when < or > is filtered:

/images/cat.jpg" onload="alert('THM');


(This uses an image onload handler to trigger JS.)

Final flag obtained after completing all levels (Level 6): → THM{XSS_MASTER}

Final task: Blind XSS session cookie value (server staff cookie):
